# DESIGN-LED-CUBE-4x4x4

For the need to decorate the house, living room, bedroom or to make a night lamp and also create an entertainment item after stressful hours of study and work. So we searched for ideas on the internet, books, newspapers,... and found the idea of making a led cube on YouTube. We can manually assemble LEDs and program them to create custom effects, decorate rooms and entertain.

In this project, we designed an LED cube consisting of 64 small white LEDs that flash with 5 effects. You can expand the number of other effects for yourself.

I have a real simulation video of my project at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aKsRKkAn_NPJ_S2D932gXNCakvpBr8Yl
